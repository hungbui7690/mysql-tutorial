/*
- MySQL UNION operator allows you to combine two or more result 
sets of queries into a single result set. 
- To combine result set of two or more queries using the UNION operator, 
these are the basic rules that you must follow:
	> First, the number and the orders of columns that appear in 
	all SELECT statements must be the same.
    > Second, the data types of columns must be the same or compatible.
- By default, the UNION operator removes duplicate rows even if you donâ€™t 
specify the DISTINCT operator explicitly.

-- 1. sample tables: t1 and t2:
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t1;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS t2;
CREATE TABLE t1 (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY
);
CREATE TABLE t2 (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY
);
INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1),(2),(3);
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (2),(3),(4);

-- 2. The following statement combines result sets 
-- returned from t1 and t2 tables:
-- 	  Because the rows with value 2 and 3 are duplicates, 
-- the UNION removed them and kept only unique values.
SELECT id
FROM t1
UNION
SELECT id
FROM t2;



-- 3. If you use the UNION ALL explicitly, the duplicate rows, 
-- if available, remain in the result. Because UNION ALL does not 
-- need to handle duplicates, it performs faster than UNION DISTINCT .
SELECT id
FROM t1
UNION ALL
SELECT id
FROM t2;



-- 4. Suppose that you want to combine the first name and last name 
-- of employees and customers into a single result set, you can use 
-- the UNION operator as follows:
SELECT 
    firstName, 
    lastName
FROM employees 
UNION 
SELECT 
    contactFirstName, 
    contactLastName
FROM customers;
-- As you can see from the output, the MySQL UNION uses the column names 
-- of the first SELECT statement for the column headings of the output.



-- 5. If you want to use other column headings, you need to use 
-- column aliases explicitly in the first SELECT statement as shown 
-- in the following example:
SELECT 
    CONCAT(firstName,' ',lastName) fullname
FROM employees 
UNION SELECT 
    CONCAT(contactFirstName,' ',contactLastName)
FROM customers;



-- 6. If you want to sort the result set of a union, you use an ORDER BY 
-- clause in the last SELECT statement as shown in the following example:
SELECT 
    concat(firstName,' ',lastName) fullname
FROM employees 
UNION SELECT 
    concat(contactFirstName,' ',contactLastName)
FROM customers
ORDER BY fullname;
-- Notice that if you place the ORDER BY clause in each SELECT statement, 
-- it will not affect the order of the rows in the final result set.



-- 7. To differentiate between employees and customers, you can add a column 
-- as shown in the following query:
SELECT 
    CONCAT(firstName, ' ', lastName) fullname, 
    'Employee' as contactType
FROM employees 
UNION SELECT 
    CONCAT(contactFirstName, ' ', contactLastName),
    'Customer' as contactType
FROM customers
ORDER BY fullname;



-- 8. MySQL also provides you with an alternative option to sort a 
-- result set based on column position using ORDER BY clause as follows:
SELECT 
    CONCAT(firstName,' ',lastName) fullname
FROM employees 
UNION SELECT 
    CONCAT(contactFirstName,' ',contactLastName)
FROM customers
ORDER BY 1;
-- However, it is not a good practice to sort the result set by column position.
