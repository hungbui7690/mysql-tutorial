-- 2. returns the order number, order status, 
-- and total sales from the orders and 
-- orderdetails tables using the 
-- INNER JOIN clause with the GROUP BY clause:

-- 4. uses three INNER JOIN clauses to 
-- query data from the four tables above:

    customerName,
    orderLineNumber,
    productName,
    quantityOrdered,
